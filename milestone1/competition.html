    <h4>What content does this site contain(The Good and bad)?</h4>
    <a>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty</a>
    <p>The Good: The page is well organized with a clear table of contents and sections, making it easy to navigate. It gives comprehensive information about the series, including main games, spin-offs, and even canceled titles. The infobox and tables provide quick facts at a glance, and the neutral tone with citations adds credibility. Images like the logo and game tables also help break up the text and give visual cues.</p>
    <p>The Bad: The page looks dense and can feel overwhelming with so much text and wide tables. Some details are repeated, and the amount of information can be hard to skim. Certain games are described in more detail than others, making it unbalanced. The controversies section is not well separated, so it can be hard to follow. The design itself is plain and lacks visual variety, and some information may be slightly outdated.</p>

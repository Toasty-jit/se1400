    <h4>What content does this site contain(The Good and Bad)?</h4>
    <a>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty</a>
    <p>The Good: The page is well organized with a clear table of contents and sections, making it easy to navigate. It gives comprehensive information about the series, including main games, spin-offs, and even canceled titles. The infobox and tables provide quick facts at a glance, and the neutral tone with citations adds credibility. Images like the logo and game tables also help break up the text and give visual cues.</p>
    <p>The Bad: The page looks dense and can feel overwhelming with so much text and wide tables. Some details are repeated, and the amount of information can be hard to skim. Certain games are described in more detail than others, making it unbalanced. The controversies section is not well separated, so it can be hard to follow. The design itself is plain and lacks visual variety, and some information may be slightly outdated.</p>
    
    <h4>What content does this site contain(The Good and Bad)?</h4>
    <a>https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Call_of_Duty</a>
    <p>The Good: The Call of Duty Fandom page has a lot of detailed content, covering story, multiplayer, weapons, maps, and characters in depth. It includes plenty of visuals like screenshots and galleries that make it more engaging than plain text. The site also has many links to related pages, so you can easily explore spin-offs, expansions, and specific topics, making it great for fans who want deeper information.</p>
    <p>The Bad: The page can feel cluttered because of the sheer amount of detail, which makes it harder to get a quick overview. The quality and consistency of sections vary, since different contributors write in different styles, and some areas are much more detailed than others. It’s also less formal and reliable than Wikipedia, with fewer citations and more fan-driven edits, so information may not always be fully accurate.</p>
    

     <h4>What content does this site contain(The Good and Bad)?</h4>
    <a>https://liquipedia.net/callofduty/Portal:Games</a>
    <p>The Good: The Liquipedia “Portal: Games” page is focused and organized, intended for people who follow Call of Duty in an esports or competitive-gaming context. It clearly lays out which games are active or relevant in tournaments, which helps readers quickly see what’s being played now. The layout tends to be clean and functional, with useful tables, match/event info links, and stats-oriented content for those who care about competition, players, schedules, etc.</p>
    <p>The Bad: Because it’s specialized, the page has limited appeal if you’re looking for general franchise history or narrative content—it’s heavy on tournament/game-versions data but light on lore or broader context. Also, esports pages often need constant updates; sections or stats can become outdated quickly. The design, while functional, can feel a bit dry or sparse for someone expecting more visual richness or storytelling.</p>
